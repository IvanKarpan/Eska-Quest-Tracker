NOTE: Following to theme system rework and some db structure changes, i couldn't migrate your appearance properties (e.g, tracker background) in the new version, so you will lost them.
Sorry for that, in the future, i will no longer encounter this issue.

I'm going to make later a post for showing more in detail the changes contained in this patch.
