* init 1.2.0 version
- NEW: Implement the "Bonus objectives" in the tracker.
- FIX: The tracker should now no longer considered the bonus objectives as world quest.
- Theme: Update Transparence & Eska.

NOTE: Small update for implementing the bonus objectives in the tracker. The bonus objectives are the bonus quests availables in some zone and that often you encounter when you're leveling.
