[1.3.6]
- NEW: Added an option to disable the quest sorting by distance (quests category).
- NEW: Added an option to hide the scrollbar (tracker category).
- NEW: Added two new actions: "Track/Stop Tracking" and "Show details" in the quest menu context. When you stop tracking a quest, the closest one will be automatically tracked.
- CHANGE: The left click on a quest will now display the quest map (allowing to see directly the zone where the objectives are and the details). The old behavior
has been moved to "Show details" action in the menu context.
- FIX: An issue where the closest quest isn't tracked (shown by a yellow arrow on the minimap) at the first loading when the blizzard objective tracker is completely disabled.
NOTE: If you use the Transparence theme, i advise you to hide the scrollbar to avoid some width issues with the tracker when
the scrolling system become active or inactive.

- FIX: An issue where the scenario module isn't loaded in the invasion scenarios.

[1.3.4]
- FIX: The quest item buttons should now display their cooldown timer.

- FIX: An issue where the quests are always clickable even when they are hidden by the scrolling system.
