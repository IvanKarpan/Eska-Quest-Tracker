[1.6.1]
- NEW: Added Objective Wrapping (enabled by default for testing).
- API: Made some revision to the Skin API.
NOTE: The main focus of this build is to bring some revision to Skin API. As a consquence, all code frames must be converted in order to use the new version.
I've made my best to keep things working, this is why you may encounter some issues related to Skin features (Text Size, Text Font, Background Color, ...)
The goal of this revision is to make optimizations, improve the code logic and prepare the work for new options.

Currently, the options has not been updated to include new features, this is planned to be done in a future alpha build once things are well set.
I forgot to talk about that in the previous build, you can use this command to remove the quest categories: /run EQT.Options:Set("quest-categories-enabled", false)
